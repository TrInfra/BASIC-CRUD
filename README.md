# BASIC-CRUD

Hello, this is my serious work as a backend developer. I believe there are various aspects that can be improved, but nevertheless, I feel that I have achieved my goal and plan to further enhance my skills.

I have prepared some intuitive images about this CRUD that I would like to share with you. They aim to demonstrate the basic functions of the CRUD term applied in Java.

This code was focused on registering clients/users and can be used for small-scale commercial systems. While not overly robust, with updates, it can be improved to achieve this goal.
